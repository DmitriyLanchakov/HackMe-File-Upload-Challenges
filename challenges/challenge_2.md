# file-upload Challenge 2

----------------------

Ok that was a pretty serious bug you found in Challenge 1. I changed my script so instead of checking for file extension, I now check for mime type of the file. The ball is back in your court - can you get anything past my upload script now?

It's available in game, you'll see it in the menu on the left with the title "Preferences Challenge 2".

Thanks again for your help!

   When your browser sends the file via the upload form to the server, your browser is automatically including a Content-Type in the request, telling the webserver the file is of type text/php (for example).

   Is it possible to have multiple extensions on a file (chained together?)
