# file-upload Challenge 4

----------------------

This is driving me nuts - the arcane knowledge required for your last trick is ridiculous.

I noticed a trend in all your exploits though. You required the file to end with .php to get your code to run. I'm going to go back to my file extension checker and just fix that up - and to be safe, I quarantined it in an iframe (I heard iframes can help contain hackers). You'll have to be more creative if you want to get past my code now! 

The new code is available in game, you'll see it in the menu on the left with the title "Preferences: Challenge 4".

Thanks again for your help!

  His iframe idea was both a bad idea and poorly coded, and merits investigation.

   Does the include() php function care what the extension of the file is?

   This challenge is two-part. Part 1 is getting your code to a local file on his server (with an image extension). Part 2 is using the local file inclusion vulnerability to load in your 'image' as though it was code.
