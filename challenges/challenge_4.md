# file-upload Challenge 4

----------------------

This is driving me nuts - the arcane knowledge required for your last trick is ridiculous.

I noticed a trend in all your exploits though. You required the file to end with .php to get your code to run. I'm going to go back to my file extension checker and just fix that up - and to be safe, I quarantined it in an iframe (I heard iframes can help contain hackers). You'll have to be more creative if you want to get past my code now! 

The new code is available in game, you'll see it in the menu on the left with the title "Preferences: Challenge 4".

Thanks again for your help!

   You can actually insert a comment inside a GIF, which anything processing that GIF ignores. That comment could be anything... it could even have characters like < and ? in it. [GIMP, a free software for manipulating images, will allow you to insert comments in gifs.](http://s116.photobucket.com/user/bayououtdoor/media/gifcomment.gif.html)
